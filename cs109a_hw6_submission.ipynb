    "In this homework, we will consider the problem of early breast cancer detection from X-ray images. Specifically, given a candidate region of interest (ROI) from an X-ray image of a patient's breast, the goal is to predict if the region corresponds to a malignant tumor (label 1) or is normal (label 0). The training and test data sets for this problem is provided in the file `hw6_dataset.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a ROI in a patient's X-ray, with columns 1-117 containing features computed using standard image processing algorithms. The last column contains the class label, and is based on a radiologist's opinion or a biopsy. This data was obtained from the KDD Cup 2008 challenge.\n",

    "Another powerful diagnostic tool for class-imbalanced classification tasks is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Notice that the default logistic regression classifier in `sklearn` classifies a data point by thresholding the predicted class probability $\\hat{P}(Y=1)$ at 0.5. By using a different threshold, we can adjust the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of the classifier. The ROC curve allows us to visualize this trade-off across all possible thresholds.\n",
