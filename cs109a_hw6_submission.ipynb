    "## Automated Breast Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will consider the problem of early breast cancer detection from X-ray images. Specifically, given a candidate region of interest (ROI) from an X-ray image of a patient's breast, the goal is to predict if the region corresponds to a malignant tumor (label 1) or is normal (label 0). The training and test data sets for this problem is provided in the file `hw6_dataset.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a ROI in a patient's X-ray, with columns 1-117 containing features computed using standard image processing algorithms. The last column contains the class label, and is based on a radiologist's opinion or a biopsy. This data was obtained from the KDD Cup 2008 challenge.\n",

Explain what these evaluation metrics mean for the specific task of cancer detection. Based on the observed metrics, comment on whether the fitted model is better than the all 0's classifier.</li>\n",
